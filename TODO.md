# Panache TODO

This document tracks implementation status for Panache's features.

## Language Server

### Code Actions

- [ ] Convert between table styles (simple, pipe, grid)
- [x] Convert between inline/reference links

### Navigation & Symbols

- [x] Find references - Find all uses of a reference link/footnote/citation
  - [x] Find references for citations - Find all `@cite` uses of a bibliography
    entry
  - [x] Find references for headings - Find all internal links to a heading
  - [x] Find references for reference links - Find all `[text][ref]` links

### Completion

- [ ] Reference link completion - Complete `[text][ref]` from defined references
- [ ] Heading link completion
- [ ] Attribute completion - Complete class names and attributes in
  `{.class #id}`
- [x] Shortcode completion - Complete Quarto shortcode names in `{{< name >}}`
- [x] Cross-reference completion - Complete `@fig-id` and `\@ref(fig-id)`
  cross-refs (also: file/shortcode path completion is implemented)

### Inlay Hints (low priority)

Personally I think inlay hints are distracting and I am not sure what we want to
support.

- [ ] Link target hints - Show link targets as inlay hints
- [ ] Reference definition hints - Show reference definitions as inlay hints
- [ ] Citation key hints - Show bibliography entries for `@cite` keys
- [ ] Footnote content hints - Show footnote content as inlay hints

### Advanced

- [x] Semantic tokens - Syntax highlighting via LSP (`semanticTokens/full`,
  additive + flavor-gated, custom legend;
  `src/lsp/handlers/semantic_tokens.rs`). Follow-ups: multi-line tokens
  (math/div bodies, per-line split); `full/delta`
  - `result_id`; `range` requests; widen the legend (emphasis/strong/links/
    headings --- only if we decide to contest the base grammar, which flips it
    to opt-in); raw-inline format tags (parser folds `{=fmt}` into a generic
    `ATTRIBUTE`, so a dedicated token kind is needed first).
- [ ] Rename
  - [x] Citations - Rename `@cite` keys and update bibliography
  - [x] Reference links - Rename `[ref]` labels and update definitions
  - [x] Headings - Rename heading text and update internal links
  - [x] Footnotes - Rename footnote labels and update definitions/links
  - [x] Files - Rename linked markdown files and update links
  - [x] Files - Rename other linked files, shortcodes, etc. Covers `embed`,
    `video`, and `placeholder` shortcode paths plus in-document frontmatter
    file paths (`bibliography`, `csl`, `css`). Deferred: raw HTML
    `src`/`href` and raw LaTeX `\input`/`\includegraphics` references;
    nested frontmatter paths such as `format.html.css`.
- [x] Configuration via LSP - `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` to reload
  config

### Spec coverage gaps

Markdown-relevant LSP methods we don't yet implement, surfaced by the 2026-06-18
spec-coverage audit (see `docs/guide/lsp.qmd` "LSP Specification Coverage").
`onTypeFormatting`, `semanticTokens`, `inlayHint`, and
`workspace/didChangeConfiguration` are tracked above and not repeated here.

- [x] Pull diagnostics - `textDocument/diagnostic` + `workspace/diagnostic` as a
  companion/alternative to the current push model (mode-switch: pull clients
  get pull only, push suppressed; cache + `workspace/diagnostic/refresh`)
  - [x] Populate `related_documents` in the document report for clients with
    `related_document_support` (the pulled document's project-graph closure
    carries its related files' cross-file diagnostics inline)
  - [x] Streaming/partial results (`DocumentDiagnosticReportPartialResult`,
    `WorkspaceDiagnosticReportPartialResult`): a `partialResultToken`
    streams the report's tail as `$/progress` chunks (response carries the
    first chunk). No token still returns the whole report
  - [ ] `workspace/diagnostic` only reports open documents + reachable project
    manifests, not every on-disk doc in the workspace (rust-analyzer pulls
    all workspace files). Decide whether closed-but-on-disk docs should
    surface.
- [x] `textDocument/documentHighlight` - highlight every occurrence of the
  reference/citation/footnote/heading under the cursor
- [ ] `textDocument/selectionRange` - structural smart-select expansion (word →
  inline → block → section)
- [x] `textDocument/linkedEditingRange` - edit a reference label and its
  definition simultaneously
- [x] `completionItem/resolve` - defer expensive completion detail (e.g.
  citation previews) until an item is focused
- [ ] `codeAction/resolve` + advertise `codeActionKinds` - compute edits lazily
  and let clients filter actions by kind
- [x] `workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders` - multi-root workspaces; config
  resolves per-document against the containing folder, and add/remove
  re-resolves open documents live
- [x] `workspace/configuration` - pull runtime settings from the client (after
  `initialized` and on `didChangeConfiguration`) instead of relying only on
  discovered config files and pushed settings
- [ ] `workspace/executeCommand` - server-side commands backing complex code
  actions
- [x] File operations beyond `willRenameFiles`: `didRenameFiles`,
  `didCreateFiles`, `didDeleteFiles` (hygiene-only;
  `willCreate`/`willDelete` intentionally omitted)

#### Out of scope for prose

These spec methods target compiled-language tooling and have no useful Markdown
analogue; do not re-audit them: call hierarchy, type hierarchy,
`textDocument/implementation`, `typeDefinition`, `declaration`, `inlineValue`,
`moniker`, document color, and code lens.

### Future Lint Rules

#### Syntax correctness

- [ ] Broken table structures
- [ ] Invalid citation syntax (`@citekey` malformations)
- [ ] Unclosed inline math/code spans
- [ ] Invalid shortcode syntax (Quarto-specific)

#### Style/Best practices

- [ ] Multiple top-level headings
- [ ] Empty links/images
- [ ] Unused reference definitions
- [ ] Hard-wrapped text in code blocks
- [ ] Use blanklines around horizontal rules

### Linter bugs and performance (quarto-web triage, 2026-08)

#### False positives: `undefined-anchor` on render-generated anchors

- [ ] `undefined-anchor` flags anchors that only exist after render: Quarto
  listing categories (`gallery/index.qmd` → `#articles-reports`, etc.) and
  include-partials that link to a heading in their *parent*
  (`_incremental-pause.md` → `#creating-slides`, linted standalone). Static
  analysis can't see these targets; consider a heuristic or an opt-out for
  known render-time / cross-document anchors.

### Configuration

- [ ] Severity levels (error, warning, info)
- [ ] Auto-fix capability per rule (infrastructure exists, rules need
  implementation)
- [ ] Unwrap the CLI's top-level error print. `main() -> io::Result<()>` renders
  a returned error via `Debug`, so a config (or any other) error surfaces as
  `Error: Custom { kind: InvalidData, error: ... }`. The inner message is
  now readable (`ConfigError`'s `Debug` mirrors `Display`), but the
  `Custom { kind }` wrapper is noise. Fixing it properly means handling
  errors at the \~13 `load_config_for_cli(...)?` call sites (or switching
  `main` to a custom error type with a `Display`-based `Termination`) so the
  user sees just `Error: invalid config <path>: ...`. Affects all
  `io::Error`s, not only config.

## Parser

### Parser bugs found by the incremental fuzzer (2026-08)

The incremental reparse fuzz harness
(`crates/panache-parser/tests/incremental_fuzz.rs`, on
`feat/incremental-parsing-graduation`) checks that a full parse round-trips its
bytes before it judges a splice --- a broken oracle cannot judge anything. That
precondition check found the following; none of them are incremental-parser
bugs. Minimized reproducers live in
`crates/panache-parser/tests/incremental_regressions.rs` on that branch.

Round-trip failures (`input` -> lossy output):

- [x] Display-math closing fence *drops* bytes (content loss, not a reorder):
  `$$\nx^2 + y\n$$$\n` -> `$$\nx^2 + y\n$$\n`. Also `$$\nx^2 + y\n$$$ra\n`
  -> `$$\nx^2 + y\n$$ra\n` and `$$\nx^2 +$$$$\n\npara\n` ->
  `$$\nx^2 +$$\n\npara\n`. `try_parse_display_math` consumed a whole closing
  dollar run while `emit_display_math` only wrote back an opener-length
  marker. Both delimiters are now exactly `$$` (pandoc's
  `mathDisplayWith "$$" "$$"`), so surplus dollars stay content or text.
- [x] Fenced-div opener mangles the whitespace run before its label, and
  duplicates part of the label: `:::  te\nbody\n:::\n\npara\n` ->
  `::: tee\nbody\n:::\n\npara\n`; `:::: \ty\n:::\n::::\n\npara\n` ->
  `:::: yy\n:::\n::::\n\npara\n`;
  `::::     outer\n::: inner\nbody\n:::\n::::\n` ->
  `:::: outeruter\n::: inner\nbody\n:::\n::::\n`. Detection trims the whole
  whitespace run after the colons, but `emit` consumed a single space before
  slicing the label off the rest, so the leftover run shifted the slice and
  the tail was re-emitted as a label suffix. `emit` now consumes the same
  run.

Adjacent, found while fixing the losslessness bugs the same harness turned up:

- [x] `parse_line` honours the block registry only for `OpenBlockQuote` effects,
  throwing away every other prepared match and re-deriving container
  structure from a raw marker count. The setext-over-a-blockquote fix
  special-cases one parser name; the general cleanup is to let the
  registry's verdict stand. Any non-blockquote verdict on the raw line now
  wins over the marker count (registry order mirrors pandoc's reader order),
  and the CommonMark same-container rule moved into
  `SetextHeadingParser::detect_prepared`, where it belongs. Still excluded:
  shifted blockquotes inside list items, where `dispatcher_ctx` carries no
  `list_indent_info` and the verdict is therefore untrustworthy.
- [x] Under CommonMark, `> a\n> ---\n` should be `BlockQuote [Header 2 "a"]`
  (pandoc's commonmark reader agrees); panache gave `BlockQuote [Para, HR]`.
  The same-container rule in `SetextHeadingParser::detect_prepared` counted
  `>` markers on `ctx.next_line`, which the blockquote-carrying dispatch
  path in `parse_line` hands over already stripped of every marker --- so
  the count was always 0. It now reads the depth off the raw lookahead line.
  The same root cause made `a\n> ---\n` a top-level `Header 2` instead of
  `Para, BlockQuote [HR]`.
- [x] Under Pandoc, `a\n> ---\n` should be one `Para` (pandoc reads it as
  `[Str "a", SoftBreak, Str ">", Space, Str "\8212"]`); panache gave
  `Header 2 "a"`. Same shape as the CommonMark bug above, but not the same
  rule: Pandoc treats a leading marker run on the *text* line as literal
  text (`> foo\n---\n` is a top-level H2 with the marker included), so the
  underline's raw depth is now compared against `ctx.blockquote_depth`
  alone. Also fixes `> a\n> > ---\n` and the indented `a\n   > ---\n`.
- [x] Under Pandoc, `> > a\n> ---\n` should be
  `BlockQuote [Header 2 [">", Space, "a"]]`; panache gave
  `BlockQuote [BlockQuote [Para]]`. Pandoc's `blockQuote` strips exactly
  *one* `>` per line and recursively re-parses the rest, so every parser
  ahead of it in the reader order --- `setextHeader` among them --- gets a
  shot at content that still begins with `>`. `Parser::blockquote_depth_cap`
  now probes the registry at each depth the line would pass through and
  stops at the first winner that outranks `BlockQuoteParser`; that depth
  caps the open and the surplus markers stay in the content as literal text.
  Rank, not effect, is the test: `BlockQuoteParser` declines outright at a
  non-zero `ctx.blockquote_depth`, so lower-ranked parsers would otherwise
  win by default (`> > a\n: b\n` keeps both quotes in pandoc).
  Pandoc-dialect only --- CommonMark reads the surplus `>` as a real
  container, not as text.
- [x] Under Pandoc, `> > a | b\n> ---|---\n` should be `BlockQuote [Table …]`
  with `> a` as the first cell (`table` outranks `blockQuote`, so the depth
  cap above applies); panache gave `BlockQuote [BlockQuote [Para]]`. Not the
  depth cap after all: `try_parse_pipe_table` required at least one row
  after the delimiter, so it declined at every depth. Pandoc reads those
  rows with `many`, so a header plus a delimiter row is already a whole
  table --- the requirement is dropped, which also makes top-level
  `a | b\n---|---\n` and `| a\n|---\n` (previously a `LineBlock`) tables, as
  pandoc has them.
- [ ] Under Pandoc, `> > a\n: b\n` should be
  `BlockQuote [BlockQuote [DefinitionList [(a, [[Plain b]])]]]`; panache
  drops the definition body and lets `: b` escape the quotes entirely as a
  top-level `Para`. Unrelated to blockquote depth (the quote nesting is
  already right, and
  `blockquote_depth_cap_declines_below_blockquote_rank_pandoc` pins it) ---
  that fixture's snapshot records the wrong `: b` placement until this is
  fixed.
- [ ] A line block inside a list item loses its indent through the formatter
  (`- x\n\n  | a\n b\n` re-formats to a line block at column 0), which then
  absorbs the following line on reparse and breaks idempotency.
- [ ] Pandoc folds an under-indented lazy line into a line block
  (`- x\n\n  | a\n b |\n` is one `LineBlock [[a, b, |]]`); panache ends the
  line block and emits the lazy line as its own block.

### Architecture

- [ ] Stop letting `pandoc_ast.rs` drift into a second-stage parser. Load-
  bearing byte-walkers (`split_html_block_by_tags`, `parse_pandoc_blocks`
  and the refs/heading-id reparse helpers) re-tokenize source the CST should
  already encode. This violates the single-pass invariant in `AGENTS.md` and
  hides structural decisions from downstream consumers (linter, salsa, LSP,
  formatter) which all walk the CST, not the projector. The guiding
  principle: when the parser computes a structural fact during its single
  pass, it must emit that fact into the CST (wrapping existing source bytes,
  `HTML_ATTRS`-style --- never synthetic tokens) instead of forcing the
  projector to recompute it. Each bucket below is its own bounded step,
  verified against pandoc-native + CommonMark (both must stay byte-identical
  or improve).

## Parser - Coverage

This section tracks implementation status of Pandoc Markdown features based on
the spec files in `assets/pandoc-spec/`.

**Focus**: Prioritize **default Pandoc extensions**. Non-default extensions are
lower priority and may be deferred until after core formatting features are
implemented.

### Block-Level Elements

### Paragraphs ✅

- [x] Basic paragraphs
- [x] Paragraph wrapping/reflow
- [x] Extension: `escaped_line_breaks` (backslash at line end)

### Headings ✅

- [x] ATX-style headings (`# Heading`)
- [x] Setext-style headings (underlined with `===` or `---`)
- [x] Heading identifier attributes (`# Heading {#id}`)
- [x] Extension: `blank_before_header` - Require blank line before headings
  (default behavior)
- [x] Extension: `header_attributes` - Full attribute syntax
  `{#id .class key=value}`
- [x] Extension: `implicit_header_references` - Auto-generate reference links

### Block Quotations ✅

- [x] Basic block quotes (`> text`)
- [x] Nested block quotes (`> > nested`)
- [x] Block quotes with paragraphs
- [x] Extension: `blank_before_blockquote` - Require blank before quote (default
  behavior)
- [x] Block quotes containing lists
- [x] Block quotes containing code blocks

### Lists 🚧

- [x] Bullet lists (`-`, `+`, `*`)
- [x] Ordered lists (`1.`, `2.`, etc.)
- [x] Nested lists
- [x] List item continuation
- [x] Complex nested mixed lists
- [x] Extension: `fancy_lists` - Roman numerals, letters `(a)`, `A)`, etc.
- [ ] Extension: `startnum` - Start ordered lists at arbitrary number (low
  priority, if we even should support this)
- [x] Extension: `example_lists` - Example lists with `(@)` markers
- [x] Extension: `task_lists` - GitHub-style `- [ ]` and `- [x]`
- [x] Extension: `definition_lists` - Term/definition syntax

### Code Blocks

- [x] Fenced code blocks (backticks and tildes)
- [x] Code block attributes (language, etc.)
- [x] Indented code blocks (4-space indent)
- [x] Extension: `fenced_code_attributes` - `{.language #id}`
- [x] Extension: `backtick_code_blocks` - Backtick-only fences
- [x] Extension: `inline_code_attributes` - Attributes on inline code

### Horizontal Rules

- [x] Basic horizontal rules (`---`, `***`, `___`)

### Fenced Divs

- [x] Basic fenced divs (`::: {.class}`)
- [x] Nested fenced divs
- [x] Colon count normalization based on nesting
- [x] Proper formatting with attribute preservation
- [x] Top-level indented lone `:::` diverges from pandoc. Panache accepted up to
  3 leading spaces on a closing fence, so `::: outer\ntext\n  :::` closed
  the div; pandoc instead treats the indented `:::` as paragraph text and
  leaves the div implicitly closed at EOF (`Str ":::"`). Fixed by tracking
  the opener's indent on `Container::FencedDiv` and rejecting a closer more
  indented than its opener in `FencedDivCloseParser` (scoped to the no-list
  frame so the #439 in-list handling is untouched). Surfaced 2026-07-28
  while fixing #439.
- [ ] Nested fenced divs inside a list item are mis-parsed: the outer div is
  left unclosed and its trailing `:::` becomes stray text, which surfaces as
  a `stray-fenced-div-markers` lint false positive (e.g.
  `docs/authoring/markdown-basics.qmd`). Minimal repro: a `- -` nested list
  whose inner item opens a `pad` div, contains a fully closed `light` div,
  then a trailing `:::` to close `pad`. Pandoc closes both divs
  (`Div .pad [ Div .light ]`); panache leaves `pad` open and strays the
  closer. Surfaced 2026-08 in the quarto-web triage.

  formatting deferred)
- [x] Extension: `table_captions` - Table captions (both before and after
  tables)
- [x] Extension: `pipe_tables` - GitHub/PHP Markdown tables (all alignments,
  orgtbl variant)

- [x] Nested inline elements in link text (code, emphasis, math)
- [x] Reference links `[text][ref]`
- [x] Extension: `shortcut_reference_links` - `[ref]` without second `[]`
- [x] Extension: `link_attributes` - `[text](url){.class}`
- [x] Extension: `implicit_header_references` - `[Heading Name]` links to header

#### Images

- [x] Nested inline elements in alt text (code, emphasis, math)
- [x] Reference images `![alt][ref]`
- [x] Image attributes `![alt](url){#id .class key=value}`
- [x] Extension: `implicit_figures`

#### Math

- [x] Inline math `$x = y$`
- [x] Display math `$$equation$$`
- [x] Multi-dollar math spans (e.g., `$$$ $$ $$$`)
- [x] Math containing special characters
- [x] Extension: `tex_math_dollars` - Dollar-delimited math

- [x] Inline footnotes `^[note text]`
- [x] Reference footnotes `[^1]` with definition block
- [x] Extension: `inline_notes` - Inline note syntax
- [x] Extension: `footnotes` - Reference-style footnotes

#### Citations

- [x] Extension: `citations` - `[@cite]` and `@cite` syntax with complex key
  support
- [x] Pandoc `notAfterString` for bare `@key`: a citation glued to a preceding
  word character is literal text, not a citation (`word@key`,
  `user@example.com`, `違法編訂@jzkhl`). Handled at the shared detection
  site via a char-before-`@` check (alphanumeric or `.` suppresses); the
  `-@` suppress-author form is exempt. Backs the `unspaced-citation` lint
  rule. Closes #448.
- [x] `notAfterString` delimiter-adjacent corner: a bare `@key` glued to a
  *resolved closing emphasis/strong delimiter* is now suppressed to match
  pandoc (`*em*@key` and `**strong**@key` are `Emph`/`Strong` +
  `Str "@key"`). The IR consults the emphasis pass's result when building
  the construct plan (`demote_bare_citation_after_emphasis_closer`), keying
  off resolved closers only, so `*@key*` (opener) and `*em*-@key`
  (suppress-author) keep the citation. No extra scan: the correction reads
  already-computed delimiter state rather than re-classifying.
- [ ] `unspaced-citation` covers citations only. A crossref glued to a word
  (`x@fig-plot`) is likewise left as text by the parser but not flagged by
  the rule; extend it to crossref keys (gated on `quarto_crossrefs`) as a
  follow-up.

  `\textbf{text}`, etc.)
- [x] Extension: `raw_tex` - Block LaTeX environments

- [x] Extension: `latex_macros` - Expand LaTeX macros (conversion feature, not
  formatting concern)

## Additional Markdown flavors

### mdsvex / Svelte-flavored Markdown

MVP support for [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io) (`.svx`, `.svelte.md`). mdsvex
(≤0.12.x) builds on `remark-parse@8`, whose options default to `gfm: true`, so
tables, strikethrough, bare autolinks, and task lists work with **no plugins**
(confirmed by the getting-started example and real plugin-free
`svelte.config.js` setups; `remark-gfm` is only for modern remark). So
`Flavor::Mdsvex` is a CommonMark-*dialect* flavor with the GFM extension set +
`raw_html` + `yaml_metadata_block` + `svelte-template`, minus the extras mdsvex
does not enable by default (footnotes, math, emoji, alerts). The `{...}`
attribute "collision" with Pandoc syntax evaporates because the CommonMark
dialect leaves every attribute extension (`header_attributes`,
`bracketed_spans`, `fenced_divs`, `raw_attribute`) off, so `{` is free for
Svelte. `svelte-template` is off for every other flavor (zero behavior change
elsewhere).

- [x] MVP: `Flavor::Mdsvex` + `svelte-template` extension; `.svx`/`.svelte.md`
  detection; CLI/WASM/schema surfaces.
- [x] Opaque, sigil-distinguished inline spans (`SVELTE_BLOCK_LOGIC` for
  `{#…}`/`{:…}`/`{/…}`, `SVELTE_TAG` for `{@…}`, `SVELTE_EXPRESSION` for
  `{expr}`), content preserved verbatim. Balanced-brace scan reused from the
  shortcode parser. Parser golden + formatter golden + unit tests landed.
- [x] **Tier 2: block-level `{#if}`/`{#each}` pairing.** Standalone Svelte spans
  (block logic `{#if}`/`{:else}`/`{/each}`, tags `{@html}`, and expressions
  `{expr}`) that occupy a whole line are now emitted as an opaque
  `SVELTE_BLOCK` leaf block (mirroring the MyST leaf-block pattern) that
  acts as a block boundary. This fixes the prior quirk where a lone-span
  paragraph adjacent to a *tight* list (no blank line) got joined onto one
  line and its inner whitespace collapsed. The equivalent quirk for Quarto
  shortcode lines (`{{< ... >}}`) is still a separate pre-existing issue and
  is not addressed here.
- [ ] **Tier 3: format the JS/Svelte inside spans** (prettier-plugin-svelte
  territory). Likely out of scope.
- [ ] String-literal-aware brace matching: a `}` inside a JS string (`{ "}" }`)
  can terminate a span early (depth-counting only). Lossless fallback
  (literal `{`), but a real Svelte tokenizer would fix it.
- [ ] AST wrappers (`syntax/svelte.rs`), LSP semantic tokens, and lint rules for
  Svelte constructs.

### MyST

MyST (`mystmd.org`, `myst-parser`) support, modeled the same way as mdsvex: a
CommonMark-*dialect* flavor whose `myst_defaults` enables MyST-specific
extensions (`myst-directives`, `myst-roles`, `myst-targets`, `myst-comments`,
`myst-block-breaks`) plus the GFM-superset rules `myst-parser` turns on
(`pipe-tables`, `footnotes`, `yaml-metadata-block`). Behavior is gated on those
extension flags, never on `Flavor::Myst` directly, so other flavors can borrow
the same shapes. Markup extras (`myst-colon-fence`, `myst-substitutions`,
dollar-math, deflists, ...) stay opt-in.

- [x] **AST wrappers (`syntax/myst.rs`).** Typed wrappers over the existing
  `MYST_*` CST kinds, wired through `syntax.rs`, each with cast-from-`parse`
  unit tests (follow the `syntax/shortcodes.rs` pattern). Landed:
  - `MystTarget` (`label()`) --- the anchor side of MyST's cross-reference
    graph; keystone for goto-def/rename/undefined-target lint.
  - `MystRole` (`name()` brace-stripped, `content()`) --- the reference side
    (`` {ref}`label` ``); pairs with `MystTarget` for reference resolution.
  - `MystDirective` (`name()`, `argument()`, `options()` over
    `MystDirectiveOption` `name()`/`value()`, `body()`) --- richest construct;
    unlocks the most lint rules.
  - `MystSubstitution` (`name()`, trimmed) --- enables the "key not defined in
    frontmatter `substitutions:`" lint.
  - Skipped `MystComment`/`MystBlockBreak` wrappers (no name/label semantics to
    expose yet); add when a rule needs them.
- [ ] **LSP semantic tokens for MyST.** Wrapper-driven classification of
  directive/role names, target labels, and substitution names. Depends on
  the AST wrappers.
- [ ] **Lint rules for MyST constructs.** Gate on the `myst-*` extension flags
  (never `Flavor::Myst` directly), via the `add-lint-rule` skill. Start with
  `undefined-references` (role target resolves to a `MystTarget`) and an
  unknown-directive/role check. Depends on the AST wrappers.

## Math Parser and Formatter

Multi-session effort --- see the `math-parser-formatter` skill
(`.claude/skills/math-parser-formatter/`) for the phased roadmap, locked-in
design decisions, and per-session workflow. Parser invariants:
`.claude/rules/math-parser.md`.

- [x] Math parser producing a lossless structural TeX CST for inline and display
  math (`MATH_CONTENT` subtree; groups, environments, commands, alignment,
  scripts, comments, and `\left`/`\right` delimiter pairs). Landed in
  `crates/panache-parser/src/parser/math.rs`.
- [x] Surface math diagnostics (unclosed/mismatched braces and environments,
  unbalanced `\left`/`\right`) through the linter and LSP. Landed as the
  always-on `math-syntax` lint rule (`src/linter/rules/math_content.rs`),
  surfaced via the registry to CLI + LSP. All diagnostics derive from the
  embedded `MATH_CONTENT` CST shape via the single shared
  `syntax::math_diagnostics` (no re-parse, no side-channel; also consumed by
  the formatter to leave malformed math verbatim); spans are the offending
  tokens' host ranges.
- [ ] Migrate the math formatter's `\left`/`\right` line-break tracking to the
  `MATH_DELIMITED` node. The break-candidate scan
  (`crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/math/linebreak.rs`) and
  `command_class` (`operators.rs`) still track delimiter depth by command
  *text* (`name == "left"`/`"right"`), which is now partly redundant with
  the structural node. Harmless as a fallback today (formatter goldens are
  byte-identical), but node-awareness would let the scan treat a delimited
  run as one opaque operand instead of re-deriving depth.
- [x] Math formatter that reformats content semantics-safely (align `&` columns,
  indent environment bodies, normalize `\\`) while preserving idempotency
  (`format(format(math)) == format(math)`), behind an experimental gate.
  Landed as `[experimental] format-math` (default off) routing
  `$$`/`$`/`\[`/`\(` math content through
  `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/math/`. Standalone `\begin{env}`
  TeX blocks stay opaque (parser keeps them as `TEX_BLOCK`) --- a possible
  follow-up.
